To resolve this issue, ensure that the pod `thanos-frontend-query-867cb577dc-5c8vn` is running and accessible. You can check the pod status using the following command:

```sh
kubectl get pods -n monitoring
```

If the pod is not running, you may need to investigate the pod logs to identify the issue:

```sh
kubectl logs thanos-frontend-query-867cb577dc-5c8vn -n monitoring
```

Additionally, verify that the service is correctly exposing port 10902 and that there are no network policies blocking the connection.


I got  pod logs showing :

```sh
kubectl logs thanos-frontend-query-867cb577dc-5c8vn -n monitoring
```

The pod logs indicate that the query node is starting and listening on port 10902 for HTTP requests and metrics, and on port 10901 for gRPC. However, the error message suggests that the connection to port 10902 is being refused.

To resolve this issue, ensure the following:

1. The pod `thanos-frontend-query-867cb577dc-5c8vn` is running and in a healthy state.
2. The service is correctly exposing port 10902.
3. There are no network policies or firewall rules blocking the connection.

You can verify the service configuration with:

```sh
kubectl get svc -n monitoring
```

And check for any network policies with:

```sh
kubectl get networkpolicies -n monitoring
```
```sh
kubectl port-forward thanos-frontend-query-867cb577dc-5c8vn 10902:10902 -n monitoring
```
